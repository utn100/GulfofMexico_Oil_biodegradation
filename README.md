# GulfofMexico_Oil_biodegradation

This project investigated the biodegradation of crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico by incubating sediments collected from various water depths ranging from 60 to 1500 m with crude oil under optimal nutrient conditions.
The study is part of trying to unveil the fate of oil in the deep sea sediment during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (2010)
